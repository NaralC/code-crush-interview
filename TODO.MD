- Abstract Octokit into an API ü§î
- Voice call not working again ü§î (trying both from localhnost works, but not when one's from a deployment) + give AV call spin/load while this is not ready

Automated tests with Cypress ü§î (https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-testing-blog/tree/main):
> API:
- Compile (does it stop when fails, response shape)
- Save/Fetch Code
- Upload to GH
- Room name change
- Pusher

> Real-time (https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/trade-offs#Multiple-browsers-open-at-the-same-time):
- WebRTC (https://webrtc.github.io/test-pages/)
- Code context/store
- Role swap
- Make a CI/CD to test before pushing to Vercel

> E2E:
- BG particle/localStorage ‚úÖ
- Create room ‚úÖ
- Join room by id ‚úÖ
- Browse room ‚úÖ
- Questions CRUD ‚úÖ

Bug Fixes:
- End interview, GH, Questions, Console btns should be dynamic depending on what's present
- When someone joins, the cursors get reset
- Supabase WS and AV device doesn't disconnect unless hard reload ‚è∏
- `DOMException: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to set remote answer sdp: Called in wrong state: stable` Voice call sometimes break ‚è∏
- `An iframe which has both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin for its sandbox attribute can escape its sandboxing.` Security issue? ‚è∏
- Initial join (and cursor names) sometimes doesn't work reliably (fe/notes) ü§î
- `repoExists` doesn't fetch all repos, rendering repo dupe check dead ‚è∏

Clean-ups:
- Room cap is only updated when someone enters/leaves. If everyone leaves simultaneously, it doesn't update
- Amongus background (https://codepen.io/matteobruni/pen/rNmMVEx)
- Monaco editor flashes when a new piece of code update comes in
- Remove streaming in the note editor
- Fixed timeouts don't work well with slow internet
- "Ending interview session" shows up when someone leaves
- Code ref is one step behind actual thing
- Try the "real-time hilighter" by switching to App Router
